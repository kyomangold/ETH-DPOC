function G = ComputeStageCosts(stateSpace, map)
%COMPUTESTAGECOSTS Compute stage costs.
% 	Compute the stage costs for all states in the state space for all
%   control inputs.
%
%   G = ComputeStageCosts(stateSpace, controlSpace, map, gate, mansion,
%   cameras) computes the stage costs for all states in the state space
%   for all control inputs.
%
%   Input arguments:
%
%       stateSpace:
%           A (K x 3)-matrix, where the i-th row represents the i-th
%           element of the state space.
%       map:
%           A (M x N)-matrix describing the terrain of the estate map. With
%           values: FREE BUILDING RESIDENT PIZZERIA DROP_OFF HOSPITAL
%
%   Output arguments:
%
%       G:
%           A (K x L)-matrix containing the stage costs of all states in
%           the state space for all control inputs. The entry G(i, l)
%           represents the expected stage cost if we are in state i and 
%           apply control input l.
